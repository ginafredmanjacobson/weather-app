# Weather App ☁️

A lightweight weather application built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
This project fetches live weather data using the OpenWeather API and dynamically updates the UI based on user input.

The goal of this build was to practice:

- Working with external APIs
- Handling asynchronous JavaScript (fetch/promises)
- Parsing JSON responses
- Updating the DOM dynamically
- Shipping a complete, usable feature independently

---

## Features

- Search weather by city name
- Live API integration (OpenWeather)
- Displays temperature, description, and weather conditions
- Basic error handling for invalid searches
- Responsive layout

---

## Tech Stack

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- OpenWeather API

No frameworks. No libraries. Pure frontend fundamentals.

---

## How It Works

1. User enters a city name.
2. The app sends a request to the OpenWeather API.
3. The JSON response is parsed.
4. Weather data is rendered dynamically into the UI.
5. Errors (e.g. invalid city) are handled gracefully.
